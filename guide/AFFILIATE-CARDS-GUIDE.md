3. **Be honest with pros/cons** - Builds trust with your audience
4. **Use appropriate badges** - "Best Overall", "Budget Pick", "Premium Choice"
5. **Include ratings when available** - Social proof increases conversions
6. **Keep features concise** - 3-4 key features work best

## Styling Notes

- Cards automatically show "Sponsored" label for transparency
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Pros/cons section is collapsible to save space
